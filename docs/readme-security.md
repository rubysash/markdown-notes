
## Security Considerations

### File Operation Safety
- All file operations include permission validation
- Cross-drive moves use integrity verification by default
- Filename sanitization prevents invalid characters and system conflicts
- User confirmation required for destructive operations

### Input Validation
- Filenames are sanitized against reserved system names
- Character filtering removes potentially harmful input
- Length limits prevent filesystem issues (64 character maximum)
- Input validation for all user-provided names and paths

### Error Handling
- Graceful degradation for permission errors
- Comprehensive exception catching with user feedback
- Fallback mechanisms for failed operations
- Safe defaults for all configuration options

## Temp Files and Encryption
- Currently Temp files are written to disk
- No attempt at privacy/encryption has been made
